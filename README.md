This is a quick summary of SOLID and OOP design terms, for a more details see the relavent JavaScript files  
S: Single Responsiblity Principle: Every function should be dedicated to one task  
O: Open-Closed Principle: Code should not require modification to be extended  
L: Liskov Substitution Principle: A sanity check on object relations  
I: Interface Segregation Principle: Do not require anything but the bare minimum to use your functions: optional behavior should be optional  
D: Dependency Inversion Principle:  

Encapsulation: Objects keep all their data private, and only allow access through helper methods 
Abstraction: The programmer calling a function does not need to understand the specific implementation of the function, only the requirements to call it and what it does  
Inheritance: A child class will have all the methods and attributes of its parents 
Polymorphism: The ability to treat a child as its parent
